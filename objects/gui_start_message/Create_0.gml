current_message = @"Hey there! Welcome to Aether version 0.0.7.65 (pre-alpha)
This is the largest update I've ever made to this game.
It's currently extremely buggy - but here's what you need
to know. I've removed several levels, and remade almost
all of the game. There's a lot of RNG involved, and I'm
extremely happy with the way it's shaping up. Enjoy.
Please do keep in mind that this game is in a very early stage,
and may crash or bug out on you. Please be patient with it, as
it will more than likely have a problem as you're playing it.
