current_message = @"This version of the game is stable. This means there will be minimal crashes.
If you do crash, notify the dev (that would be Josh) on Twitter @Jdudegaming and he'll see if he can't fix it! For reporting a new bug you'll be greatly rewarded :D

-- At any time in game (if you get stuck, or just want to restart) you can reset the game by holding R and pressing L and you'll 
return to the start screen. Please do note, this resets the music and it will not play. You must restart the game completely to re-initialize the audio engine.

-- DevTools and DevMode are two different things. DevTools allow you to do simple things such as enable/disable gamepad,
and enter/exit DevMode. DevMode actually let's you use Development commands. Here's how to use the DevTool commands:
To activate and deactivate Devmode, press C. After you deactivate DevMode, you'll be in post-dev mode. Post-dev mode is specifically just to 
remind the user that DevMode has been used in the past. To activate Gamepad mode (Basic Bluetooth compatible) 
Press G whenever you enter a level. Pressing G on the start screen will do nothing. To activate Keyboard/Mouse mode, Press ''H'' 
while in a level. Please do keep in mind that there is not full controller support, and using a controller may not work throughout the entire game.
To turn Shaders on/off press Y on the keyboard at any time.
These are the DevMode commands: Hold P and press 0 (zero) for 99999 lives and fully automatic bullets
-- Notes:
Due to some insane problems with V-Sync, it's been turned off for now.
Due to strange problems due to GMS2's Vsync, the game runs natively in windowed-fullscreen. Due to popular demand, this will soon be managable in the options menu.
